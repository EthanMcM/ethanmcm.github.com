Some questions are better answered with data, some with graphics and some without. 

Regardless of the question, my answer will have a graphic and maybe I値l use some data along the way.

The questions I値l be asking mostly relate to the things I encounter in my daily life. Speaking of my daily life, I知 an economics and statistics double major at Rice University in Houston, TX. I hope to give this blog the ole college try but I do have other aforementioned commitments. In any case I値l do my best to always keep it relevant and interesting.

I値l mostly be programming in R but not every post will involve coding. I might throw in something different from time to time. Who knows?

One,

Ethan
